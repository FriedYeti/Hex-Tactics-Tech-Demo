# Hex Tactics Tech Demo

A tech demo featuring hexagonal grid based maps that are randomly generated and three units that are able to traverse the map.

Full list of features implemented:
* Dynamic hexagonal grid creation
* Different tile types, including movement costs and traversability
* Perlin noise based map generation
* Unit and tile selection
* Camera movement and rotation
* Modified Dijkstra's Algorithm based pathfinding utilizing a custom PriorityQueue
* Arrows showing a units path through the map
* Turn limited movements

A playable demo is available on [itch.io](https://friedyeti.itch.io/hex-tactics-tech-demo).

The hexagonal grid and the pathfinding are based off of the articles from [Red Blob Games](https://www.redblobgames.com/).
